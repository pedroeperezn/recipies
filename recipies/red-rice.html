            Making mexican red rice is very simple! The key difference is that, instead of boiling the rice in plain or salted water, we boil it in a tomato broth which gives the color and taste to the rice. It is very common to it this version of rice as a side dish or as an extra ingredient in tacos. Let's get to it!
