        <h3>Descritpion</h3>
        <p>
            Pambazos are another very traditional mexican recipe. It is a very common dish to find specially in the central part of Mexico (Mexico City and its surroundings). Its combination of peppers, potato, sour cream, chorizo and cheese makes it a perfect dish for people who don't eat spicy food regularly.

            Pambazos are basically a pan fried potato puree sandwich dipped in pepper sauce. They are normally garnished with fresh lettuce, grinded fresh cheese, and sour cream. The combination of flavours and textures makes them an addictive yet refreshing experience.

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>7 guajillo peppers (remove seeds and stem prior preparation)</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>350g of chorizo</li>
            <li>3 potatoes</li>
            <li>8 pambazo breads (can be substituted with a sub style bread)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of shredded fresh cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Dipping sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil peppers:</strong> First, boil your peppers (all seeds and the stem should have been removed previously). Let them boil for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Blend the ingredients:</strong> Once the peppers are cooked, blend them with 1/4 onion, one garlic clove, and some of the water you used to boil the peppers. Then, strain and set aside the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Stuffing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare your potatoes</strong>: Finely chop your potatoes, then fry them with two tablespoons of canola oil at medium heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the chorizo:</strong> Remove the skin of your chorizo. Once your chorizo is ready, add it to the potatoes and let them fry together.</li>
            <li><strong>Lightly crush the potatoes:</strong> Once the potatoes become tender, lightly crush them and mix with the chorizo. The stuffing should be chunkier than mashed potatoes and mixed evenly with the chorizo.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Final Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stuff your pambazos:</strong> Cut in half your bread. Then, add the stuffing to the bread. The pambazo should be evenly stuffed and it should be easy to close it completely.</li>
            <li><strong>Dip the pambazo in the sauce:</strong> Grab the pambazo with some tweezers and dip thoroughly in the sauce. The pambazo should be completely covered in the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Pan fry the pambazo: </strong> Add a little bit of oil to a pan and then pan fry the pambazo. Let it cook until each side of the pambazo is slightly black (its not burned, its the color that the pepper sauce gets when fried).</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Open your pambazo and garnish it with lettuce, cheese and sour cream to taste. Enjoy!</li>
